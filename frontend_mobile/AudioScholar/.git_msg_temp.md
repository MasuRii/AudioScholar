fix(build): resolve compilation and JDK configuration errors

Resolved a series of build failures that prevented the debug APK from being assembled.

- Fixed Kotlin compilation errors in several Jetpack Compose screens related to incorrect parameter usage in a `MarkdownText` component. The `color` parameter was being passed directly, whereas the component expected it via its `style` property.
- Corrected an `Unresolved reference: fillMaxHeight` by adding the necessary import in `AboutScreen.kt`.
- Resolved a critical build environment issue by updating the `org.gradle.java.home` property in `gradle.properties` to point to a valid JDK installation, fixing the `Unable to determine version for JDK` error.
