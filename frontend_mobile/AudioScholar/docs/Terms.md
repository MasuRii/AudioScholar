# AudioScholar Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** April 05, 2025

Welcome to AudioScholar! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the
AudioScholar mobile application and web interface (collectively, the "Service").

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If
you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

**1. Use of the Service**

* **Eligibility:** AudioScholar is primarily designed for students, particularly those in higher
  education (college students). By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are at
  least 13 years of age. If you are under 18, you must have the permission of a parent or legal
  guardian to use the Service.
* **License:** We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the
  Service for your personal, non-commercial educational purposes, subject to these Terms.
* **Restrictions:** You agree not to:
    * Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.
    * Copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service.
    * Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks.
    * Interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service.
    * Use any automated system, including robots, spiders, or offline readers, to access the Service
      in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably
      produce in the same period by using a conventional web browser.
    * Circumvent, disable, or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Service.
* **Offline Capabilities:** AudioScholar provides offline recording functionality. While you can
  record offline, AI processing, cloud synchronization, and accessing cloud-stored content require
  an internet connection. Your use of offline features is still subject to these Terms.
* **Optional PowerPoint Uploads:** You have the option to upload lecture PowerPoint presentations to
  provide context for AI analysis. You are responsible for ensuring you have the necessary rights to
  upload and share these presentations.
* **Synchronization:** You can choose between automatic and manual cloud synchronization of your
  recordings. You are responsible for managing your synchronization settings and understanding the
  data transfer implications of each option.

**2. Accounts**

* **Account Creation:** You can create an account by logging in with your Google account or GitHub
  account.
* **Account Responsibilities:** You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
  account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us
  immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
* **User Tiers:** AudioScholar offers different user tiers: Non-Logged-In, Logged-In Free, and
  Logged-In Premium. The features and limitations of each tier are described on our website and
  within the application. Your access to certain features (e.g., cloud storage, number of summaries,
  background recording, recommendation sources) is dependent on your user tier.

**3. Content**

* **Your Content:** You retain all rights to the audio recordings and any optional PowerPoint
  presentations you upload to the Service.
* **License to Us:** By using the Service and uploading content (including recordings and
  presentations), you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, store,
  process, and display your content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service to
  you. This includes transmitting your content to external AI APIs for processing and generating
  summaries and recommendations.
* **AI-Generated Content:** The summaries and recommendations generated by the Service are based on
  AI processing of your content. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of
  AI-generated content. AI-generated content is for informational purposes only and should not be
  considered a substitute for your own understanding and review of lecture material.
* **Third-Party Content:** The Service may provide recommendations for learning materials from
  third-party sources (e.g., YouTube, potentially licensed educational content). We are not
  responsible for the content of these third-party resources. Your access and use of third-party
  content are subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties.

**4. Fees and Payment**

* **Freemium Model:** AudioScholar operates on a freemium model. Access to certain features is
  limited for non-logged-in and logged-in free users.
* **Premium Subscriptions:** If you choose to subscribe to a premium account, you agree to pay the
  applicable subscription fees. Subscription terms and pricing are outlined on our website and
  within the application.
* **Payment Processing:** Payment for premium subscriptions will be processed through third-party
  payment processors. We do not store your full payment card details.

**5. External AI APIs**

AudioScholar utilizes external AI APIs, including Google Gemini AI API, for processing your lecture
audio and optional presentations. Your content will be shared with these APIs for transcription,
summarization, and recommendation generation. The use of these APIs is subject to their respective
terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the actions or omissions of these
external AI APIs.

**6. Termination**

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or
without notice, effective immediately.

* **User-Initiated Termination:** You can terminate your account and stop using the Service at any
  time. Instructions for account deletion can be found within the application settings.
* **Effect of Termination:** Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease.
  If you have a paid premium subscription, you may not be entitled to a refund for any unused
  portion of your subscription.

APPLICABLE LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR
