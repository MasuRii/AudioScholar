# AudioScholar Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** April 05, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how AudioScholar ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses
your information when you use our mobile application and web interface (collectively, the "
Service").

By using AudioScholar, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this
policy.

**1. Information We Collect**

We collect several types of information in connection with your use of the Service:

* **Information You Provide Directly:**
    * **Account Information:** When you log in using Google OAuth 2.0 or GitHub OAuth 2.0, we
      collect your unique User ID provided by the respective service. We do not collect or store
      your password for these services.
    * **Lecture Metadata:** Information you provide about your lectures, such as titles or
      descriptions.
    * **Uploaded Content:** Lecture audio recordings you make using the app and any optional
      PowerPoint presentations you upload.
    * **User Preferences:** Settings you configure within the app, such as synchronization options.
* **Information Collected Automatically:**
    * **Device Information:** Information about the device you use to access the Service, including
      device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers.
    * **Usage Data:** Information about how you use the Service, such as the date and time of
      recordings, features accessed, and interactions within the app and web interface.
    * **Log Data:** Information that your browser sends whenever you visit our web interface,
      including your IP address, browser type, and access times.
* **Information from External APIs:**
    * **AI Processing Data:** Audio recordings and optional PowerPoint presentations are sent to
      external AI APIs (specifically, Google Gemini AI API) for processing, transcription,
      summarization, and recommendation generation. The data processed by these APIs is subject to
      their own privacy policies.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* **To provide and maintain the Service:** Including recording and storing your lectures, processing
  audio, generating summaries, and providing access to your content.
* **To personalize your experience:** Including providing customized recommendations for learning
  materials.
* **To improve and develop the Service:** We analyze usage data to understand how our Service is
  used and identify areas for improvement.
* **To manage your account:** Including authenticating users and managing user preferences.
* **To communicate with you:** Including sending you service-related notifications.
* **To ensure the security of the Service:** We use information to detect and prevent fraudulent or
  unauthorized activity.

**3. Data Storage and Retention**

* **Local Storage:** Recordings are initially stored locally on your device.
* **Cloud Storage (for Logged-In Users with Synchronization Enabled):** Recordings are stored
  securely in Firebase Storage. Summaries, lecture metadata, user data, and preferences are stored
  in Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database.
* **Data Retention:** We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Service and
  for legitimate business purposes. You can delete your recordings, summaries, and account data
  within the application. We may retain some information for a limited period for backup, archival,
  or legal purposes.

**4. Disclosure of Your Information**

We may disclose your information in the following circumstances:

* **To External AI APIs:** We share your audio recordings and optional PowerPoint presentations with
  external AI APIs (specifically, Google Gemini AI API) for the sole purpose of processing,
  transcription, summarization, and recommendation generation. These third-party services have their
  own privacy policies governing their use of your data.
* **With Your Consent:** We may disclose your information with your explicit consent.
* **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response
  to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency request).
* **To Protect Our Rights:** We may disclose your information to protect our rights, property, or
  safety, or the rights, property, or safety of others.
* **In the Event of a Business Transfer:** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset
  sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

**5. Offline Capabilities**

AudioScholar offers robust offline capabilities for recording. While recordings are initially stored
locally, AI processing, cloud synchronization, and accessing cloud-stored content require an
internet connection. Your data is processed and stored differently depending on whether you are
using the Service online or offline, and whether you are a logged-in user with synchronization
enabled.

**6. Third-Party Services**

AudioScholar utilizes several third-party services, including Firebase (for database, storage, and
authentication), Google OAuth 2.0, GitHub OAuth 2.0, and Google Gemini AI API. These third-party
services have their own privacy policies and terms of service, and we encourage you to review them.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party services.

**7. Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or
disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100%
secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

**8. Children's Privacy**

AudioScholar is intended for use by students, particularly in higher education (college students).
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a
parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information,
please contact us, and we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

**9. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the
new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
